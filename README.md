Knowledge Check Assignments Data Analytics Tuesday Class


Below are instructions from Knowledge Check 1:
* a statement that prints "hello world!"
* a list populated with several values. They can be strings / integers / floats etc. Then, print() one of those values either to the prompt or in a cell (if using Jupyter Notebook)
* a dictionary populated with two keys and two values. Print one of the values just like you did above.
* a tuple with 4 values. Print one of them.
