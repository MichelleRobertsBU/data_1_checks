##Knowledge Check Assignments Data Analytics Tuesday Class


Below are instructions from Knowledge Check 1 first class:
* a statement that prints "hello world!"
* a list populated with several values. They can be strings / integers / floats etc. Then, print() one of those values either to the prompt or in a cell (if using Jupyter Notebook)
* a dictionary populated with two keys and two values. Print one of the values just like you did above.
* a tuple with 4 values. Print one of them.

##Knowledge Check 2 from first class is listed in folder KnowledgeCheck1.py under kc_2.py

Per the example information where data was obtained:

This directory includes a few sample datasets to get you started.

california_housing_data*.csv is California housing data from the 1990 US Census; 
more information is available at: https://developers.google.com/machine-learning/crash-course/california-housing-data-description

##Knowledge Check 1 from second class (DataC2KC1Sept2.py):
* Pull in data from an API.
* Find and print TWO descriptive statistics about your data.
* Write a query in Pandas to select a particular set of your data.
* Select and print the SECOND AND THIRD columns of your data frame.
* Select and print the FIRST 4 rows of you data frame.

The API from Punk API does not need a key. https://api.punkapi.com/v2/beers. 
Imports include pandas and requests. It was created in 
Visual Studio using Python. 

##Knowledge Check 2 from second class (cleaning data sets)

* Make a .py (or .ipynb) file that contains the following (your choice of editor does not matter!) and do the following:
  find and access a data set in any way you want. You can use an API, a CSV, anything.
* Fix TWO issues with the data set using techniques you've learned in class. Here are some common fixes:
* Remove null values
* Fill in null values with 0's or blanks
* fill in blanks
* fix character strings that aren't formatted correctly (you could use regex for this)
*  correct column names if they're misnamed
*  correct spelling (for example, you might have a Country column with an entry that says "Unted States of America".)
There are hundreds of other things you could fix depending on the issues, so don't worry about whether or not your fix "counts" for the check. It most likely will if you're fixing something.
